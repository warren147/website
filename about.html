                <h2>More About Me...</h2>
                <p>I'm Bo-Wei(Warren) Chang, a junior studying computer science and data science. I've always been very interested about technology and its potential to make this world a better place. Whether itâ€™s developing innovative software solutions or exploring the potential of AI and machine learning, I am driven by a deep passion to use technology as a force for good. <br><br> Outside of school and work, I really enjoy playing golf and video games. Golf is a sport that challenges me to think strategically and stay calm under pressure, which are skills that translate well into my work and school. Video games, on the other hand, fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills. Whether Iâ€™m on the golf course or immersed in a game, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to push myself, learn new things, and have fun along the way!</p>
